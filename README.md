# <Homework Week 1>
## Here is what I did 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation? This Page functioned fairly well but the code in the CSS needed to be cleaned up. 
- Why did you build this project? I enjoyed cleaning up the CSS and HTML code in this page. There was a lot of unecessary labels that we cleaned up and condesened a lot of the CSS code. Chaotic code is very hard to read. Life is hard and so is code so let's make it easier.
- What problem does it solve? Making the css code cleaner by condesing it and elimanting un needed code is much easier for the eyes and for other developers to view. Looking over the HTML there was a broken link in the in the nav bar that we also fixed using a simple ID tag. 
- What did you learn? I learned about adding comas to CSS tags to make thing easeir and more organized. I learned you can move to a different place on the page using just HTML with a # and an a href element. This also made me think about what else you can do just using HTML and CSS and not adding any Javascript.
