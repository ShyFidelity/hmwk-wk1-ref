# <Homework Week 1>
## Here is what I did 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation? Understanding the importance of elements! Also the importance of organization.
- Why did you build this project? This Page functioned fairly well but the code in the CSS needed to be cleaned up. There were also several elements missing in the HTML. WHile the page still functioned it didn't read very well. Chaotic code is very hard to read. Life is hard code shouldn't have to be(any harder than it already is).
- What problem does it solve? Making the CSS code cleaner by condesing it and elimanting un needed code is much easier for the eyes and for other developers to view. Looking over the HTML there was a broken link in the in the nav bar that I also fixed using a simple ID tag. 
- What did you learn? I learned about adding comas to CSS tags and putting them on one line to make thing easeir and more organized. I learned you can move to a different place on the page using just HTML with a # and an a href element. This also made me think about what else you can do just using HTML and CSS and not adding any Javascript.
